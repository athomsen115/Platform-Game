# Platform-Game

Movement Files is not really a game, more of an understanding of how to start a platform game and get characters that move on the screen. There is a good skeleton and a bad skeleton. The good skeleton can shoot bullets and kill the bad skeleton. Still working on character improvements.

In the process of building a full platform game. Potentially starting with just a side-view slider game where the background moves, and there are obstacles, but no platforms to climb/jump on. Still working on adding objects to collect, lives and a scoring system. Stay tuned to see how it progresses.
